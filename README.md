# Lumina-Interview-Project

The program generates a webpage that takes the users first name and last name, returning their favourite movies in a table. There is a second button that is supposed to upload a new entry into the database but it currently isn't working.

Backend - NodeJS
Database - PostgreSQL
Frontend - ReactJS

How to test:
Install the libraries via npm.
Start the backend by 'npm start' in the server folder.
Load the webpage by 'npm start' in the client folder.

Known Errors:
Currently, if the second button (labelled "Add") is pressed, the program breaks returning the error: "Proxy error: Could not proxy request /insert from...". I've tried my best to solve this issue to no avail. I kept the code in to show what I worked on.

Next Steps:
Implement the other CRUD operations in the program.
Add some error checking in the user inputs.
Change the CSS files to give the webpage a nicer appearance.
